# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Explorer React

This project is my first step into front-end development using React! ðŸš€ It consumes a movie API to display information about films, allowing users to explore different titles dynamically.


Working on this project has been an exciting journey, as Iâ€™ve learned key React concepts such as components, hooks, and how to fetch data from an API. It was a great hands-on experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of building interactive web applications.


This is just the beginning! I plan to improve and expand the project over time, refining both functionality and UI. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!
